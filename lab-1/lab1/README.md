# Description of programming principles in code:
1) DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Code uses interfaces and shared methods for shared actions.
For example, the Display() method for displaying the currency price is used in the classes UkrainianHryvnia, Euro, and Dollar,
instead of repeating the code for each class.
